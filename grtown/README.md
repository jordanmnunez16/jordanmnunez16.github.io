## Artist Statement

Describe what you were trying to make:

## Straightforward Checks

Please list how your assignment fills the requirements. In cases where you have more than the requirements (e.g., 2,3,5,6) just list the most interesting ones. A short description (a few words) is probably sufficient. Leave blank or say "N/A" for things you didn't do.

Note: the other checks we can see easily.

2. 2 different kinds of objects that you made (just list 2)
    1. Forklift Crane
    2. Pyramid

3.  5 different kinds of objects beyond #2. (just list 5)
    1. House
    2. Dirt Pile
    3. Car
    4. Road
    5. Cement Mixer

5. 3 different behaviors. (just list 3)
    1. Forklift Crane moving dirt (Paired with dirt growing/shrinking)
    2. Car drives around map
    3. Cement Mixer makes a road and then drives on it

6. At least 3 objects must be "rideable"
    1. Forklift Crane
    2. Car
    3. Cement Mixer

7. "train track" with a "train" (tell us how we know its a spline)
    1.

8. One object from each category
    - buildings: Pyramid
    - natural elements: Palm trees
    - vehicles: Car

9. There is at least one model loaded from a file. (e.g. loading a `.obj` or `.fbx` file)
    1. Palm tree, found at https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/1189852

10. There is at least one shader that you wrote.
    - what object is it on:
    - describe: Shader from assignment 8-2 in workbook 11. The face of the object is dark if the user is looking at it from a side angle. This shader is used to make the person on the side of the house.
    - filename: 8-2.vs and 8-2.fs

12. SkyBox or some other texture (list one - and say why you didn't have skybox if you don't have one)
    1. Environment map found at https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-hdri-environment-map-round-panorama-spherical-panorama-equidistant-projection-land-under-heaven-image96046684

## Complexity Points

Describe each thing that you did that you think is worth complexity points.

If possible, order them from most interesting to least interesting.

Describe what the thing is, where we can see it, and why it deserves complexity points.

Note: put "####" (4 hash marks) and number the complex things to make it easier for us to identify them, but put the description on a separate line. We've given you the first 2 headers

#### Complex Thing 1:

Forklift Crane moving dirt: The forklift crane moves back and forth from one pile of dirt to the next. It takes dirt from one pile, and puts it on the other pile. As it does this, the pile it takes away from gets smaller, and the pile it is adding to becomes larger. Once one of the piles is fully depleted, it switches so that it moves dirt from the full pile to the empty pile.

#### Complex Thing 2:

Cement Mixer paving roads: The cement mixer paves roads. Once it is done, the barrel on the back of it tilts up and stops rotating, signifying that it has finished laying down cement.

## Screenshots

List the pictures that you made with a brief description

Screenshot 1, Forklift Crane: Shows forklift crane lifting up dirt from a dirt pile.
Screenshot 2, Cement Mixer: Shows cement mixer paving roads.
Screenshot 3: Shows car in front of pyramid and palm tree.
Screenshot 4, Person in house: Shows person looking out of house window, made with a shader.
